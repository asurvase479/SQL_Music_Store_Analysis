# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis
🎶 Excited to Share My SQL Music Store Data Analysis Project! 🎶

I recently completed an insightful SQL project focused on analyzing data from a music store database — covering everything from customers and employees to tracks, albums, invoices, and playlists!

🔍 Key Highlights:

Extracted insights on top-selling tracks and most popular genres

Analyzed revenue trends across regions and time periods

Identified customer purchasing patterns

Explored relationships between artists, albums, and playlists

Structured complex joins and subqueries across 10+ relational tables

📊 Tools Used:

SQL (PostgreSQL)

ER diagram understanding

Data normalization & relational integrity

💡 This project strengthened my skills in database design, query optimization, and real-world data interpretation — all critical for roles in data analysis and business intelligence.

🚀 Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or a professional in the music or analytics industry, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
